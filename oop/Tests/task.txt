Modify your department:

+ change giving salary method: if there is not Employee in manager's team, raise SalaryGivingError(You should create the Error class)

+ Add method add_to_team(array) to manager class, which adds employees to team.

If there are not Employees in array, raise your own NotEmployeeException and if Employee is Manager,
raise WrongEmployeeRoleError with parameter "second_name".
String representation of error should return message "Employee @second_name@ has unexpected role!"

In Department class create method add_team_members(manager, array) which tries to add array
of Employees to manager team. Handle the exceptions, raised in manager's add_to_team method.


Cover your basics task functions with unit tests. (Possible to use setUp() while testing)
