Create structure for department:
+ There are 3 types of employee: developer, designer and manager
+ Each employee has: first name, second name, salary, experience (years)
+ Each designer, developer or manager can have higher managers

+ Each designer has effectivness coefficient(0-1)

Each manager has team of developers and designers.

Department should have list of managers(which have their own teams)

Department should be able to give salary (for each employee message: "@firstName@ @secondName@: got salary: @salaryValue@")

+ Each employee gets the salary, defined in field Salary.
+ If experiance of employee is > 2 years, he gets bonus + 200$, if experiance is > 5 years, he gets salary*1.2 + bonus 500

+Each designer gets the salary = salary*effCoeff

Each manager gets salary + 200$ if his team has >5 members
300$ if his team has >10 members
salary*1.1 if more than half of team members are developers.

Redefine string representation for employee as follows: "@firstName@ @secondName@, manager:@manager secondName@, experience:@experience@"
